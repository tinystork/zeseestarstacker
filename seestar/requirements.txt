# --- Optional: CuPy for GPU Acceleration (Stacking) ---
# If you have an NVIDIA GPU and the CUDA Toolkit installed, you can install
# CuPy for potential stacking speedup. Replace 'XX' with your CUDA major version
# (e.g., 11 or 12) and '.x' if needed, or check CuPy installation docs.
# Example for CUDA 12.x: pip install cupy-cuda12x
# Example for CUDA 11.x: pip install cupy-cuda11x
# Find your CUDA version: nvcc --version
# Check CuPy docs for exact package name for your CUDA version:
# https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html
# cupy-cudaXXX
